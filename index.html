  <h1 class="fade-in" >🌍 What Reddit Comments Reveal About Climate Conversations</h1>
  <p class="fade-in" style="color: rgb(182, 134, 38); font-size: 1.5em;">Climate change isn’t just a scientific issue — it’s a profoundly social one. </p>
  <p class="fade-in">Across online platforms, millions of people are expressing their thoughts, concerns, and debates on the topic. But what exactly are people talking about when they talk about climate?
  <p class="fade-in">To explore this, we analyzed <strong><em>over 100,000 Reddit comments</em></strong> using a frequency-based and sentiment-aware approach, uncovering both the major topics of conversation and the emotions behind them.</p>
</section>

<section id="treemap" class="section-green" data-nav="green" style="height:auto;">
  <h2 class="fade-in">🔍 First Look: What Are People Talking About?</h2>
  <p class="fade-in">Our starting point was an interactive treemap designed to organize Reddit climate conversations into a two-level hierarchy:</p>
  <p class="fade-in">The outer layer represents five major topics: <span style="color: rgb(182, 134, 38); font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Climate Change, Global Warming, Bernie, Energy, and World.</span></p>
  <p class="fade-in">The inner layer displays the top 10 most frequent words associated with each topic.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="fade-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;"> Each word block’s size shows how often it appears, while the color can be adjusted by three metrics:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-list fade-in">
        <li>Count (frequency)</li>
        <li>Avg Sentiment Score (emotional positivity/negativity)</li>
        <li>Avg Comment Score (community approval)</li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <h3 class="fade-in">🔍 Key insight from the treemap:</h3>
  <p class="fade-in">Terms like <strong> carbon, years, world, and energy </strong> appeared frequently across discussions, reflecting strong focus on emissions, long-term change, and resource topics.</p>
  <p class="fade-in">Meanwhile, emotional analysis revealed that discussions around <strong>"global" and "warming" </strong>tend toward more negative sentiment, while broader terms like<strong> "world" and "years" </strong>earn higher Reddit approval.</p>
  <br>
  <h3 class="fade-in">🔍 From Overview to Deeper Insights</h3>
    <p class="fade-in">Guided by the treemap findings, we focused next on two important directions for deeper exploration:</p>
</section>


<section id="globalwarming" class="section-warm" data-nav="warm" style="height:auto;">
  <h2 class="fade-in">🌡️ Part1: Global Warming — Are We Getting Hotter?</h2>
  <p class="fade-in">Given the central role of <span style="color: rgb(182, 134, 38); font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"global warming"</span> in discussions — and its strongly negative emotional tone — we turned from conversation to climate data itself.</p>
  <br>
<p class="fade-in">The following map visualizes global temperature anomalies over time — showing how Earth’s surface temperature has shifted across the decades.</p>

<div class="hint fade-in">
    <a href="methodology.html#method-globalwarming" style="color: inherit;">Methodology for this visualization </a>
  </div>
  <br>
    <h3 class="fade-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">🔍 Key Observation:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-list fade-in">
        <li>Warming trends are especially pronounced in the northern latitudes.</li>
        <li>Temperature anomalies have steadily increased, especially in recent decades.</li>
        <li>Public discourse about “global warming” aligns with observable environmental changes.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="fade-in">This shows how public concerns are rooted not just in social discussion with no evidence, but in measurable scientific reality.</p>
</section>

<section id="worldyears" class="section-blue" data-nav="blue" style="height:auto;">
  <h2 class="fade-in">📈 Part 2: “World” and “Years” — Tracking the Timeline of Change</h2>
  <p class="fade-in">The treemap also revealed frequent mentions of <span style="color: rgb(182, 134, 38); font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">"world" and "years"</span>, suggesting a focus on global, long-term dimensions of climate change.</p>

  <p class="fade-in">To explore this further, we visualize monthly temperature distributions for different countries over more than a century.</p>

    <div class="hint fade-in">
        <a href="methodology.html#method-worldyears" style="color: inherit;">Methodology for this visualization </a>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3 class="fade-in" style="margin-bottom: 0;">🔍 Key Findings:</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-list fade-in">
        <li>Clear seasonal and yearly variations in temperature patterns across countries.</li>
        <li>Public conversation about "years" and "world" mirrors real-world data showing long-term climate shifts.</li>
        <li>People's concerns about timeframes are scientifically validated.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class="fade-in">Through this lens, we see how online conversations reflect not only emotion, but a deep engagement with actual climate timelines

<section id="conclusion" class="section-light" data-nav="light">
  <h2 class="fade-in">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="fade-in">Starting with a broad exploration of Reddit climate conversations, we traced the public's focus into two specific areas — global warming and long-term world change — and validated these concerns with scientific data.</p>
  <p class="fade-in">This approach reveals a powerful intersection between public discourse and real-world environmental shifts.</p>
  <p class="fade-in">The public’s focus on "global warming" matches rising temperature anomalies worldwide. Discussions about "world" and "years" mirror the timeline of global climate change.</p>
  <p class="fade-in">Understanding these connections is crucial. As the climate crisis intensifies, our ability to combine data storytelling with scientific evidence may be key to informing, persuading, and inspiring action.
