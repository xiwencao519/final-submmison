            <h3>Treemap of Climate Topics & Sentiment</h3>
            <p style="text-align: start;">The original dataset was downloaded from <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavellexyr/the-reddit-climate-change-dataset"
                    style="color: inherit;"> Kaggle </a>, and this dataset contained millions of records, making it
                impractical to process fully. Therefore, we randomly extracted 100,000 comments, ensuring a diverse and
                representative selection for further analysis.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start;">After sampling, we performed text cleaning, which involved removing URLs,
                special characters, HTML entities, and standard English stopwords. We then conducted a word frequency
                analysis to identify the 20 most common words across the comments.
            </p>
            <img src="image/methology_1.jpg" alt="orignal design for visualization 1"
                style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
            <p style="text-align: start;">During this stage, we manually grouped semantically related words to create
                clearer, more meaningful topics for analysis.</p>
            <p style="text-align: start;">For example:
                We combined "climate" and "change" into the single topic "Climate Change", since these terms
                overwhelmingly co-occur and refer to the same central idea. Similarly, we combined "global" and
                "warming" into "Global Warming" to capture a specific climate phenomenon often discussed together.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start;">From the top 20 most frequent words, we selected five major topics for deeper
                exploration:
                climate change, global warming, bernie, energy, and world.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 0;">The selection process was partly subjective but guided by several criteria:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list" style="text-align: start;">
                <li>Words like climate, global, warming, carbon, energy, world, years clearly pointed to climate-related
                    concepts or environmental issues.
                </li>
                <li>We excluded frequent but less meaningful words such as:
                    <br>
                    -- "people," "think," "make," "time," "need," "way," and "going", because although these are common
                    in conversation, they were too generic to represent distinct discussion themes.
                </li>
                <li>Words like "bernie" were retained because they suggest discussion around climate politics and
                    activism, especially related to Bernie Sanders.
                </li>
                <li>Words such as "just," "don," and "bot" were considered junk artifacts ‚Äî often related to Reddit's
                    conversational filler language or spam ‚Äî and were excluded.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
                <p style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 0;">This curation allowed us to focus the treemap and subsequent analysis on terms that are:
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet-list" style="text-align: start;">
                    <li>Both highly frequent in climate conversations,</li>
                    <li>And widely recognizable as meaningful in public discourse about climate change.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: start;">In summary, while some judgment was involved, our selections aimed to preserve the core substance of Reddit climate discussions without letting generic filler words dilute the analysis.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: start;margin-bottom: 0;">We then designed an interactive treemap visualization with a two-level hierarchical structure:
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet-list" style="text-align: start;">
                    <li>The outer layer represents the five major topics we identified.</li>
                    <li>The inner layer displays the top 10 most frequent words associated with each topic.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <img src="image/methodology_1_2.png" alt=" design for visualization 1"
                    style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                <p style="text-align: start;margin-bottom: 0;" >The size of each word block is proportional to its frequency within its topic, and this layout remains fixed across different interactions. Users can dynamically recolor the treemap by selecting among three metrics:
                </p>
                <ul class="bullet-list" style="text-align: start;">
                    <li>Count: Reflects word frequency, with darker colors indicating higher counts.</li>
                    <li>Average Sentiment Score: Recolors blocks based on the emotional tone (ranging from negative to positive) of comments mentioning the word.</li>
                    <li>Average Comment Score: Shades blocks based on the average Reddit upvote score for comments containing that word.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align: start;">Changing the metric only alters the color encoding; the size and structure of the treemap remain constant, enabling easy comparison of different dimensions without losing spatial context.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: start;">In addition, clicking on a specific word block reveals five randomly selected Reddit comments that include the chosen word, with the word highlighted in yellow. This allows users to directly observe how individual words are used in real conversations.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: start;">Finally, due to internal storage and processing limitations on Render (the platform used to host the interactive dashboard), we further restricted the working dataset to 10,000 rows. </p>

            <h3>Global Warming Temperature Map</h3>
            <p style="text-align: start;">To visualize long-term trends in global warming, we used <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ " style="color:inherit"> historical temperature anomaly data</a> from NASA‚Äôs GISTEMP project. Specifically, we obtained the Land-Ocean Temperature Index (LOTI) dataset with ERSSTv5 sea-surface temperatures and 1200 km spatial smoothing, provided in compressed NetCDF format.
