            <h3>Treemap of Climate Topics & Sentiment</h3>
            <p style="text-align: start;">The original dataset was downloaded from <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavellexyr/the-reddit-climate-change-dataset"
                    style="color: inherit;"> Kaggle </a>, and this dataset contained millions of records, making it
                impractical to process fully. Therefore, we randomly extracted 100,000 comments, ensuring a diverse and
                representative selection for further analysis.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start;">After sampling, we performed text cleaning, which involved removing URLs,
                special characters, HTML entities, and standard English stopwords. We then conducted a word frequency
                analysis to identify the 20 most common words across the comments.
            </p>
            <img src="image/methology_1.jpg" alt="orignal design for visualization 1"
                style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
            <p style="text-align: start;">During this stage, we manually grouped semantically related words to create
                clearer, more meaningful topics for analysis.</p>
            <p style="text-align: start;">For example:
                We combined "climate" and "change" into the single topic "Climate Change", since these terms
                overwhelmingly co-occur and refer to the same central idea. Similarly, we combined "global" and
                "warming" into "Global Warming" to capture a specific climate phenomenon often discussed together.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start;">From the top 20 most frequent words, we selected five major topics for deeper
                exploration:
                climate change, global warming, bernie, energy, and world.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 0;">The selection process was partly subjective but guided by
                several criteria:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list" style="text-align: start;">
                <li>Words like climate, global, warming, carbon, energy, world, years clearly pointed to climate-related
                    concepts or environmental issues.
                </li>
                <li>We excluded frequent but less meaningful words such as:
                    <br>
                    -- "people," "think," "make," "time," "need," "way," and "going", because although these are common
                    in conversation, they were too generic to represent distinct discussion themes.
                </li>
                <li>Words like "bernie" were retained because they suggest discussion around climate politics and
                    activism, especially related to Bernie Sanders.
                </li>
                <li>Words such as "just," "don," and "bot" were considered junk artifacts ‚Äî often related to Reddit's
                    conversational filler language or spam ‚Äî and were excluded.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 0;">This curation allowed us to focus the treemap and subsequent
                analysis on terms that are:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list" style="text-align: start;">
                <li>Both highly frequent in climate conversations,</li>
                <li>And widely recognizable as meaningful in public discourse about climate change.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: start;">In summary, while some judgment was involved, our selections aimed to preserve
                the core substance of Reddit climate discussions without letting generic filler words dilute the
                analysis.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: start;margin-bottom: 0;">We then designed an interactive treemap visualization with a
                two-level hierarchical structure:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list" style="text-align: start;">
                <li>The outer layer represents the five major topics we identified.</li>
                <li>The inner layer displays the top 10 most frequent words associated with each topic.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="image/methodology_1_2.png" alt=" design for visualization 1"
                style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
            <p style="text-align: start;margin-bottom: 0;">The size of each word block is proportional to its frequency
                within its topic, and this layout remains fixed across different interactions. Users can dynamically
                recolor the treemap by selecting among three metrics:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list" style="text-align: start;">
                <li>Count: Reflects word frequency, with darker colors indicating higher counts.</li>
                <li>Average Sentiment Score: Recolors blocks based on the emotional tone (ranging from negative to
                    positive) of comments mentioning the word.</li>
                <li>Average Comment Score: Shades blocks based on the average Reddit upvote score for comments
                    containing that word.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: start;">Changing the metric only alters the color encoding; the size and structure of
                the treemap remain constant, enabling easy comparison of different dimensions without losing spatial
                context.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start;">In addition, clicking on a specific word block reveals five randomly selected
                Reddit comments that include the chosen word, with the word highlighted in yellow. This allows users to
                directly observe how individual words are used in real conversations.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start;">Finally, due to internal storage and processing limitations on Render (the
                platform used to host the interactive dashboard), we further restricted the working dataset to 10,000
                rows. </p>

            <h3>Global Warming Temperature Map</h3>
            <p style="text-align: start;">To visualize long-term trends in global warming, we used <a
                    href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ " style="color:inherit"> historical temperature anomaly
                    data</a> from NASA‚Äôs GISTEMP project. Specifically, we obtained the Land-Ocean Temperature Index
                (LOTI) dataset with ERSSTv5 sea-surface temperatures and 1200 km spatial smoothing, provided in
                compressed NetCDF format.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start;">This dataset offers monthly gridded temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2024,
                with each grid point representing the deviation in ¬∞C from the 1951‚Äì1980 baseline climatology, on a
                2¬∞√ó2¬∞ latitude-longitude grid.</p>

            <p style="text-align: start;">The following data processing steps were applied:</p>
            <p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Temporal averaging:</strong>For each selected year, we calculated the
                annual mean temperature anomaly by averaging all twelve months. This generated a single, continuous
                global anomaly field per year, highlighting the overall temperature trend.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Spatial interpolation and smoothing:</strong> The original GISTEMP
                data
                has a relatively coarse spatial resolution of 2¬∞√ó2¬∞, which can produce blocky or jagged visualizations
                and result in some small-scale noise.</p>
            <img src="image/methodology2_1.png" alt=" orignal flat map for visualization 2"
                style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
            <img src="image/methodology2_2.png" alt=" orignal 3d map for visualization 2"
                style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
            <p style="text-align: start;">These visulaizations using the 2¬∞√ó2¬∞ data are uncontinuous and hard to read.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start; margin-bottom: 0;">To create smoother, more continuous maps:
            </p>
            <ul class="bullet-list" style="text-align: start;">
                <li>Linear interpolation was performed, resampling the data onto a finer 1¬∞√ó1¬∞ grid. This step increases
                    the resolution, filling in intermediate points between original measurements using weighted
                    averages, while preserving the larger structure of the anomaly field.
                </li>
                <li>After interpolation, we applied Gaussian smoothing with a standard deviation of œÉ = 1.2 degrees.
                    This smoothing:
                    <br>--Reduces pixel-level noise and enhances the overall visual coherence of the map
                    <br>--Ignore small, random fluctuations in the data, allowing for a clearer representation of
                    larger-scale
                    temperature patterns.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: start;">Importantly, areas with missing data (NaNs) were carefully handled.
                We use the valid data from nearby grid points to fill in these gaps, ensuring that the final map
                accurately reflects the underlying temperature patterns without introducing artificial anomalies.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start;">These data processing steps ensure that the resulting
                anomaly maps are both visually coherent and faithful to large-scale temperature structures, making
                global warming patterns easier to interpret without distorting major trends.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Data Source Acknowledgment:</strong>The data used in this analysis
                comes from:
                NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), GISTEMP v4 Land-Ocean Temperature Index (LOTI), using
                ERSSTv5 ocean data and 1200 km smoothing.

            <h3>World & Years: Temperature Trend Analysis</h3>
            <p style="text-align: start;">The dashboard utilizes two datasets: <a
